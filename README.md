# py-fx-scraper

## Overview

This is an script to scrape FX data and store it in 60s OHLC candles.      

## Motivation

Coding interviews commonly focus on trivial tasks, 'set' problems, how to quicksort.  Here is a quick and dirty script, intented as alternative to evoke more meaningful discussion.               

Suggest ways this script could be improved by refactoring, and/or extended by adding features.  How does a prototype like this fit into a enterprise development framework?  Whats missing?          

The following concepts are illustrated.

* Fail Over
* Activity Design  
* Modularity
* Recursion
* Exception handling
* Simple lossless compression 
* Logging
